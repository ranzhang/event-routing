      "\n",
      "1. **Immediate Actions:**\n",
      "   - **Contact Emergency Services**: Dial your local emergency number immediately (in the USA, call 911).\n",
      "   - **Evacuate the Premises**: Ensure all occupants leave the building promptly and move to a safe distance away from the fire.\n",
      "   - **Use Fire Extinguishers for Small Fires**: If the fire is small and manageable, use a Class A, B, or C fire extinguisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Fire Management Techniques:**\n",
      "   - **Close Doors When Exiting**: Close doors and windows behind you to contain the spread of the fire.\n",
      "   - **Avoid Using Lifts**: Use staircases instead of elevators to evacuate the building.\n",
      "   - **Safety Precautions**: Assist those who need help evacuating, such as children, the elderly, and people with disabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Post-Containment Actions:**\n",
      "   - **Do Not Re-enter the Building**: Wait until emergency personnel give an all-clear to re-enter your property.\n",
      "   - **First Aid**: Provide or seek first aid for any injuries sustained. Treat minor burns with cool water (not ice), and seek medical attent ion for significant injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Preventive Measures:**\n",
      "   - **Fire Alarms**: Install working smoke alarms and change the batteries regularly.\n",
      "   - **Emergency Plan**: Develop and practice an emergency evacuation plan with your household or workplace.\n",
      "   - **Avoid Overloading Electrical Circuits**: Ensure wiring, cords, and power points are not overloaded; regularly check electrical appliances.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you'll take essential steps towards managing and mitigating the fire event safely. Note that the above actions are general; always adhere to local fire safety regulations and listen to the instructions from emergency responders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we should consider contacting technical support for the API endpoint issue to resolve the configuration or any server-side errors.\n",

      "### Detailed Instructions to Handle the Fire Event\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the returned data and previously provided general fire safety information, here are the detailed steps to handle the fire event:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Immediate Actions:**\n",
      "   - **Contact Emergency Services**:\n",
      "     - Dial your local emergency number immediately (e.g., 911 in the USA).\n",
      "   - **Evacuate the Premises**:\n",
      "     - Ensure all occupants leave the building promptly and move to a safe distance away from the fire.\n",
      "   - **Use Fire Extinguishers for Small Fires**:\n",
      "     - If the fire is small and manageable, use a Class A, B, or C fire extinguisher.\n",
      "     - Ensure you know how to operate a fire extinguisher safely.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Containment Steps:**\n",
      "   - **Close Doors When Exiting**:\n",
      "     - Close doors and windows behind you to contain the spread of the fire.\n",
      "   - **Avoid Using Elevators**:\n",
      "     - Use staircases instead of elevators to evacuate the building.\n",
      "   - **Safety Precautions**:\n",
      "     - Assist those who need help evacuating, such as children, the elderly, and people with disabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Post-Evacuation Actions:**\n",
      "   - **Wait for an All-Clear**:\n",
      "     - Do not re-enter the building until emergency personnel give the all-clear.\n",
      "   - **First Aid**:\n",
      "     - Provide or seek first aid for any injuries sustained.\n",
      "     - Treat minor burns with cool water (not ice), and seek medical attention for significant injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Preventive Measures:**\n",
      "   - **Fire Alarms**:\n",
      "     - Install working smoke alarms and change the batteries regularly.\n",
      "   - **Emergency Plan**:\n",
      "     - Develop and practice an emergency evacuation plan with your household or workplace.\n",
      "   - **Avoid Overloading Electrical Circuits**:\n",
      "     - Ensure wiring, cords, and power points are not overloaded; regularly check electrical appliances.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Utilize Provided API Data (if applicable)\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the response contains generic data, ensure to leverage any specific instructions or additional data provided within the API response by extracting relevant actionable details that may assist in preventing further harm or assisting emergency services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following these guidelines will ensure essential actions are taken to manage and mitigate the fire event safely. Always adhere to local fire safety regulations and listen to instructions from emergency responders. Additionally, it’s important to continuously review, practice, and update emergency plans to ensure successful execution during real events.\n",

      "Based on the returned data and general safety protocols for dealing with flooding, here are the detailed steps to handle the flooding event:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ensure Safety**:\n",
      "   - **Turn Off Electricity**: If it is safe to do so, turn off electricity to avoid electrical hazards. Do not touch any electrical equipment if you are standing in water.\n",
      "   - **Avoid Flood Waters**: Stay away from flood waters as they can contain hazardous materials.\n",
      "   - **Evacuate the Area**: If you are in danger, evacuate the area immediately and move to higher ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prevent Further Damage**:\n",
      "   - **Stop Water Source**: If the flooding is due to an internal source like a burst pipe, and if it is safe, turn off the water supply.\n",
      "   - **Protect Belongings**: Move valuable items, important documents, and electronics to higher ground to prevent water damage.\n",
      "   - **Use Sandbags**: If available, use sandbags to help prevent water from entering the premises.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Contact Emergency Services**:\n",
      "   - Dial your local emergency number immediately if there is a danger to life or severe flooding.\n",
      "   - Provide clear information about your location and the extent of flooding.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **After Flooding Actions**:\n",
      "   - **Do Not Re-enter Flooded Areas**: Avoid re-entering flooded areas until authorities declare it safe.\n",
      "   - **Clean Up Safely**: Use protective clothing such as gloves and boots during clean-up. Dispose of damaged items appropriately.\n",
      "   - **Check for Mold**: Monitor for mold growth and take appropriate actions to eliminate mold.\n",
      "   - **Report Damage**: Document the damage with photos and contact your insurance company as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Prevent Future Flooding**:\n",
      "   - **Check Drains and Gutters**: Ensure that drains, gutters, and downspouts are clear of debris.\n",
      "   - **Install Flood Barriers**: Consider installing flood barriers or shields if you live in a flood-prone area.\n",
      "   - **Create an Emergency Plan**: Develop an emergency flood response plan and practice it with your household.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Utilize Provided API Data (if applicable)\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the response contains generic data, ensure to leverage any specific instructions or additional data provided within the API response by extracting relevant actionable details that may assist you or emergency services.\n",
